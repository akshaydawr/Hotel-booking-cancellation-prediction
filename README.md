# Hotel Cancellation Prediction Model
People can benefit from the project by making predictions for their personal use case. I followed the guidelines set by my university to ensure the quality and level of my project. 

## Key Features

- **Cancellation Prediction**: Forecast the likelihood of hotel bookings being canceled.
- **Personal Use**: Apply the model to personal or business use cases for improved decision-making.

## Setup

1. **Prerequisites**: Python and necessary libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, Pandas).
2. **Data**: Load and preprocess hotel booking data.
3. **Model**: Train and evaluate the prediction model.
4. **Usage**: Use the model to predict cancellations based on input data.
